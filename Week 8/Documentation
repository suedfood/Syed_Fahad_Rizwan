# Arduino Assignment 1.0

## Idea

Attempting to create an electronic circuit that uses a non-physical stimuli to produce a response, I was driven to use stapler, producing a blue LED light output everytime the stapler was pressed. While this could be a purely aesthetic addition to the design, it might be important visual information while teaching children how to use staplers.
